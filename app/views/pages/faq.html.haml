  %h2 We give you focus. 
  %h3 It is very common for startup teams to have each member working on their own pet project.  We have seen that it is way more beneficial if the team as a whole has a single weekly goal.  This helps people come together and solve problems as a team.

  %h3 nReduce is a community of creators, as this is the case we expect each startup to give feedback to the other startups in their group and therefore they can expect to receive feedback as well.  The more engaged you are in the community the more other founders will want to collaborate with you.
